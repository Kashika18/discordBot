"Crisis affects us all in different ways. There is no right way to cope with stressful times, but there are things you can do to manage these emotions." With this in mind we have decided to make a discord bot, “Mindfulness”- Be kind to your mind.

The theme of our project being Mental Health Awarenes, 
 Mindfulness would provide with:

	1. daily motivational messages
	2. certain verified helpline numbers and websites 
	3. tips and tricks to tackle stress and anxiety

Tech Stack Used:
	We have used discord.py library of python to make the discord bot and access its various functions. A discord bot was made and authorized using discord developer portal.Other libraries used in the code were os, requests and json to access content from the world wide web.

There are 5 .py files

	1. [main.py]- this is the main code

	2. [encouragement.py]- is the file with encouragement quotes

	3. [sad_words.py] - has a list of sad words in response to which, the bot replies an encouraging quote.

	4. [tip.py]- contains tips to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

	5. [keep_alive.py] - it runs the code in the background, so the bot never goes offline.
	 
keep_alive.py uses: https://uptimerobot.com/login?rt=https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard#upgradeAccount
